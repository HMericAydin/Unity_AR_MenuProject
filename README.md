# Unity_AR_MenuProject
While you thinking about your orders, you can visualize the food on the menu.

## Description
In that project the menu has 4 categories. Soups, Starters, Dishes and Drinks. When a food has been chosen its description, price and rate will be shown on the left of screen.

If you click add button your food will be chosen in that category. When you're exit from that category your decision still will be visible.

## Project will be improved.
I'm not a designer. Therefore, I used only free assets from the Unity Asset Store. Moreover UI parts might be more attractive.Additionally, I cannot find a menu table. That's why I just use a photo which was taken with one of my friends' wedding :)
